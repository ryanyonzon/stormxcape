## stormXcape

A web collaboration application written in Ruby, using Rails framework.
Written back in 2007 when Rails framework was starting to get traction.

But unfortunately, the initial plan (of using Ruby on Rails) was never pushed through.
And the application was ported to PHP, using a custom PHP framework.
Thus [Orinoco Framework](https://github.com/ryanyonzon/Orinoco) was born.
